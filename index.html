		5 Resons to play American football
		</p>
		<li>Fitness:

			Physical strength, endurance, agility, speed and flexibility are all enhanced from participation on a football team. Most of these assets are gained in practice. Strength training through calisthenics and weights, plyometric drills, agility drills with tires and ladders, sprints and various stretching regimens are all incorporated into regular practice and running plays.
		</li>
		<li>
			Discipline:

			Players must overcome fatigue, maintain concentration and remain prepared for surprises on the field in order to win ball games. This is instilled through repetition, the coach’s leadership and positive peer pressure. History provides ample record of teams defeating opponents of superior strength and ability through the sheer force of will power.
		</li>
		<li>
			Cooperation:

			Teamwork goes beyond a group deciding to work together. It is achieved when they do so smoothly and efficiently. A quarterback must have a feel for the speed and agility of his receivers. Likewise, defensive players must have a sense of where each teammate is in order to foil a play or limit yardage gains by the opposing team. When players see the advantage of cooperating in a single effort, they can utilize it in their academic and professional lives.
		</li>
		<li>
			Humility:

			Despite talent, drive and instinct, even the best players get frustrated. There is nothing like defeat to winnow out the ego, vanity and rigidness that can poison a football team. Whether a setback is suffered by an individual or the team as a whole, it can serve as a teachable moment for athletes. The Syracuse University team discovered this in the early 1990s, when a mediocre season followed on the heels of a successful one.
		</li>
		<li>
			Fraternity

			Sharing in victories, defeats, sufferings, discipline and learning invariably forges bonds among players. The athletes learn to appreciate one another’s good points – and tolerate their annoyances. Former Indianapolis Colt Rob Morris recalls many friendships made with college and pro teammates, and credits them with having built his character. He does not miss the game so much as the company of his colleagues.
